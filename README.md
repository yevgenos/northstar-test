Thanks to everyone that's put up with me and helped out with this project, it's been a fun passion project i've had throughout 2021 so releasing it is pretty cathartic  
Specifically: thanks to the Icepick developers for making the Icepick, I initially forked it for earlier versions of Northstar and it was a great base to experiment with stuff on before moving to the custom launcher  
Thanks to everyone on R5R team for giving me advice on some later parts of development  
Thanks to everyone in the testing server for putting up with me and helping find bugs  
Thanks to everyone else that's helped, gave advice, all that
